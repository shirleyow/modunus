## Purpose of Project 
moduNUS is a web app that is targeted at helping NUS students with their General Education (GE) curriculum planning. Students can gather useful information about GE modules easily through the search and filter features. On top of that, moduNUS also showcases a dashboard for each module, which provides statistics for the module based on reviews given by users on our website, to help other students planning to take the module gain a deeper understanding of what they are in for. 

## Project Motivation 
Students often find it exhausting to compare between General Education (GE) modules manually with platforms like NUSMods and IVLE. In addition, it might be difficult or troublesome for the student to obtain information about whether there are webcasts offered for the module, or whether the module has group projects. There is also a lack of reviews on NUSMods, which we believe can be ameliorated by allowing students to review the modules anonymously and with simple guiding questions.

Therefore, we strive to create moduNUS, a web app that will help students gather critical information about GE modules easily by filtering through the modules based on the student’s preferences or by searching for a specific module using the search bar. On top of these, users can contribute by leaving anonymous reviews for modules they have taken before (with guiding questions to make the process easier), and the dashboard overview for each module (constructed based on the reviews given by users) will serve as a rating summary of the module.

## User Stories 
As a student who is looking for a suitable GE module to take, I want to be able to compare GE modules quickly and efficiently based on my own preferences.
As a student who is lost about the suitable GE modules to take, I want to be able to see modules’ reviews by seniors in a clear and visually-appealing way.
As a student who has taken a GE module, I want to have a platform to share my reviews easily (preferably with guiding MCQ questions to ease the process) for module juniors, where I can be anonymised.
As an administrator who wants to prevent abuse of the system, I want to be able to review the reviews uploaded in the comment section and remove inappropriate reviews posted.
 
## Scope of the Project 
Due to time constraints with regard to data collection, moduNUS currently does not support all modules offered by NUS. moduNUS supports various pillars of the General Education (GE) curriculum, which includes GET (Thinking and Expression pillar), GES (Singapore Studies pillar) and GEH (Human Cultures pillar). GER and GEQ are excluded as students are pre-allocated with a specified module for both pillars, and therefore benefits of moduNUS for these pillars are limited. 

There are plans to extend the modules available on moduNUS to all the modules offered by NUS after the Orbital programme.
