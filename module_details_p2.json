Yet, as we all know, the evolution of Singapore, from classical regional emporium to international port city and strategic naval base, has all along been defined by much larger regional and international forces.  After its emergence as a sovereign state in 1965, Singapore continues to project itself as a 'global city-state'.  Our local society has an 'international' make-up, being the product as it were of historical and current diasporic trends.  This module provides an international framework for a study of the history of Singapore, and seeks to examine the historical evolution of Singapore against the contexts of regional and international changes and developments from the 14th to the 20th century.  This module is open to all students throughout NUS interested in Singapore history/studies.",

The course is meant to not only understand and analyse Gandhi’s thought but also to outline his extraordinary legacy. The course will develop critical thinking and expression of students in two ways. First, it will introduce students to and make them critically engage with Gandhi’s writings and ideas on several issues, including violence and conflict resolution, colonialism, modernity, ethics, science, health and environment. The aim would be to not only expose students to the complexity of Gandhi — the man and his ideas — but to critically interrogate Gandhi and his legacies. Gandhi is particularly suited to such an exercise since he held positions that were often controversial and counter-intuitive, both during his lifetime as well as today.  Second, the students will develop their expression skills, verbal and written, by evaluating Gandhi and his legacy through presentations, take-home assignments and examinations. The students will develop their thinking and expression skills through an analysis not only of texts but also of films and documentaries on Gandhi.",

Physics on the other hand, studies the fundamental relationship between matter, energy, space, and time. Many people may consider them to be in different regimes and require different mindsets to work on. But as both disciplines advanced, it became increasingly clear that the interactions between them are far more pervasive and fundamental than one might expect. For example, the field of biophysics has risen since the 1950s, and it has vastly changed how biologists look at living systems or study biology. It proved that the mindsets of biology and physics can join together to provide deeper insight into the phenomenon we call life. We will base the material on the basic laws of physics, and discuss how they are interwined with all kinds of life science and daily life phenomena, from cells to ecosystems and from Earth to outer space. Through reading this module, the students would be able to think deeper about the daily phenomena around them, and understand better the foundation of life on Earth.",

It also assesses the social, economic, political and environmental impacts of increasing interconnectedness and mobilities.",

    "description": "Games being a form of human activities since antiquity are often played with strategies that require critical thinking and decision making. Many of the number games like the game of nim have a rich mathematics favour. Real life social games contain combinatorial and probabilistic strategies. Simple economic activities can also be modelled in terms of games.  In this module, selected real-life social games are discussed and treated in ways that bring out their mathematical creativity. The objective is to let students gain an appreciation of mathematics, its beauty and applications through the discussion of some of these games. In particular, we give an introduction of elementary non-zero sum and non-cooperative game as developed by von Neumann and Nash.",

What most people think they know about Darwin, his life and his famous book ‘On the origin of species’ is wrong. This module provides a solid background for understanding how the theory of evolution actually unfolded. It covers the history of geology, palaeontology and biology from the 1700s to the 20th century. The central focus is on the life and work of Charles Darwin and how biological evolution was uncovered, debated and accepted by the international scientific community in the 19th century, and beyond. There will be a lot of myth busting and this provides case studies on how to assess historical claims and evidence, and discussions on recent developments in evolutionary biology, human evolution and anthropology are included.",

    "description": "Our capacity for language is a defining aspect of what it means to be human and is central to both thought and communication. This course investigates the rules that underlie what we say, how meaning is encoded, and how we reason with language. We will apply mathematical tools of pattern description and logic to describe and better understand human language, with the goal of developing logical explanations for linguistic phenomena. Comparison to artificial and programming languages will be discussed. Emphasis will be placed on clear, precise descriptions and their accessible communication through writing and oral presentation.",

The focus is not on individual societies or\ntime periods, but on questions related to commonalities in developments across all societies. This approach is like looking at a painting from a\ndistance instead of at the brush strokes that constitute it, and will lead to questions about what human activities and experiences constitute the global\nexperience. As part of the Thinking and Expression pillar, this module will help students think historically and also critically engage the maxim that ‘the past is a foreign country.’",

(i.e. creations that are interpreted as art, or not art, at different times), and Where is art?\n(i.e. why something is perceived as art when it is in one setting, but is generally otherwise unnoticed). Visits to Singapore locations for case studies are required. Students will study and apply several disparate theories, and will also write their own.",

It highlights how these narratives ignited imaginations and aroused ethical and societal concerns. Students will learn how science through its thinking and process have generated narratives, and in turn how these narratives have\nchanged our thinking and beyond.",
